      Starting a blog as a developer isn't just about writing code ‚Äî it's about
      sharing what you've learned,
      <Link href={"https://youtube.com"}>Link component</Link> building in
      public, and improving your communication. In this post, I'll walk you
      through how I built this blog from scratch, what tools I used, and what I
      learned along the way.

      One of the biggest lessons I learned was how powerful it is to keep things
      simple at the start. Instead of overengineering, I focused on shipping the
