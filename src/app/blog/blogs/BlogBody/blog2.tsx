      From Simple Mechanisms to Complex Systems
    </SubHeading>

    <Paragraph>
      Machines have revolutionized how humans work, live, and create. From basic
      tools to advanced robotics, machines amplify our capabilities. In this
      post, we'll explore the different types of machines, how they function,
      and where you'll commonly find them in use.

      ‚öôÔ∏è Classification of Machines
    </Heading>

    <List>
      <li>Simple Machines (Levers, Pulleys, Inclined Planes)</li>
      <li>Compound Machines (Wheelbarrows, Scissors)</li>
      <li>Electrical Machines (Motors, Generators)</li>
      <li>Electronic Machines (Computers, Calculators)</li>
      <li>Automated Machines (Robots, CNC Machines)</li>
    </List>

    <Paragraph>
      Using <Mark>machine classification</Mark> helps in understanding their
      function and scope. For example, a lever and a crane both move heavy
      loads, but one is manual while the other is mechanical or electrical.

    <Heading headingType="sub">üìã Key Examples & Use Cases</Heading>

    <OrderedList>
      <li>Lever: Used in crowbars, scissors</li>
      <li>Inclined Plane: Found in ramps, slides</li>
      <li>Motor: Powers fans, washing machines</li>
      <li>Robot Arm: Used in manufacturing assembly lines</li>
    </OrderedList>

    <Paragraph>
      A key takeaway is that machines don't have to be complex to be impactful.
      Even a simple inclined plane can drastically reduce human effort.
      <Mark>Efficiency is the real innovation.</Mark>
